The Cybersecurity Incident Tracking System is a Java-based console application designed to help track and manage cybersecurity incidents. It allows users to register as either Admins or Analysts, log in, and perform various actions such as reporting incidents, viewing reported incidents, and managing them. Admins have elevated permissions, allowing them to view all incidents, while Analysts can only log and view their own reported incidents.
